            <h2 class="textcenter">Welcome to James's Sheet Music!</h2>
            <p class="indent">This page is where you can find all my music transcriptions, new and old. I use <a href="https://musescore.com" rel="external">MuseScore</a> to create all my scores, and then I upload them here for the public to enjoy. I always strive to make my transcriptions sound as true to the original song as possible, although I am by no means a professional and I also edit sections that sound awkward when transcribed, so 100% accuracy is not guaranteed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em>No profits</em> are made from any of my works, nor do I ever intend to. Music transcription is purely a passion project/hobby I enjoy doing with songs I love listening to alongside my other hobbies. All my works are available to the public free of charge.</p>
            <p class="indent">While it is not required, I highly recommend you (1) check out the sources for the songs I transcribe to help out the original creators, and (2) share this page and/or my works with other people. It makes me happy knowing that there are people out there who are listening to what I've done.</p>
