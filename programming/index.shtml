            <h2 class="textcenter">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="indent">Over the years, I have started working on various programming projects in my personal time. This page will contain an overview of all projects (that I think are worth mentioning) I have worked and/or am currently working on. Note that this section will <em>not</em> contain any projects related to <a href="/hpn">Half Past Noon</a>. All projects here are either personal (i.e. under my own name) or done for or with an organization that is not Half Past Noon.</p>
            <p>Not all projects will be open-source. If you would like to view a copy of the source code for a closed-source project, please feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> and ask for which project(s) you would like to view and why. Please note that closed-source projects are <i>closed-source</i> for a reason, and I reserve the right to refuse to disclose any project assets to anyone for any reason, especially if they have no real reason for me to show them anything.</p>

            <h2 class="textcenter">Discord Bots</h2>
            <p class="textcenter">Here is a list of my main <a rel="external" href="https://www.discordapp.com">Discord</a> bots.</p>
            <p class="textcenter">This list does not include all of the bots I have ever made, but the vast majority of my other bots are extremely simple and are not worth mentioning.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>WrightBot</b></li>
                <li class="nobullet">
                    <ul>
                        <li>WrightBot is a "fun" (i.e. "just-for-fun") bot inspired by Capcom's Ace Attorney franchise. It's a very simple bot; in only has a few chat commands to post GIF images or randomly generate some accusations, for example.</li>
                        <li>Fun Fact: WrightBot was my very first programming project that I made with a friend in 8th grade to learn JavaScript.</li>
                        <li><a rel="external" href="https://github.com/1230james/WrightBot">GitHub repository</a><br/><i>WrightBot is undergoing an overhaul to replace the years-old, antiquated code it currently runs on</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>The Donald</b></li>
                <li class="nobullet">
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Donald is also a "fun" bot much like WrightBot in terms of its features and capabilities. The bot was inspired by <a rel="external" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thewallgrows">a Reddit bot that kept track of the height of an imaginary wall</a>.</li>
                        <li>I would like to emphasize that <em>I nor this bot are affiliated with Donald Trump and do not intend to convey a political message or stance in any way</em>.</li>
                        <li>There is <strong>no</strong> repository for this bot. Do not ask to see this bot; you will be rejected regardless of who you are (unless I'm ordered to by law).</li>
                        <li>This bot is also no longer online due to limited resources on my part.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>PilotBot</b></li>
                <li class="nobullet">
                    <ul>
                        <li>PilotBot is a utility bot that provides some simple tools to make a few common tasks (e.g. getting current Zulu time or pulling <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR">METAR</a> reports from online) more convenient to do.</li>
                        <li>This project is closed-source. Please contact me to view the repository.</li>
